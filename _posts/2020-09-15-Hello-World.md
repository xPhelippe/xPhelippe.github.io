title: Making a blog at 9:30 PM

#Hi everyone!

my name is *Phelippe*. You can call me Phil though. I am a senior at Florida Polytechnic University studying Computer Engineering. I have plenty of other homework to do, but I thought I would create a blog instead. I have struggled over the years with completing projects, telling all my friends that I have big plans and then not following through with them. Now, that definitely makes a great talking point to talk about all my plans, but in the end, I look back on all my talk and can't help but feel dissapointed in myself for not following through. 

Flash forward to tonight. A friend told that I could make a blog using github and I said I would do it (again with telling people I am going to do things). Thankfully, this is one of the rare times I actually sat down and finished a project.

Now, what can you expect? Not much honestly. I'll use this website as more of a public extension of my journal. Hopefully, I will refrain from coming here after a big breakup, but if I don't, I guess the internet will get a good laugh (or cringe) from my venting. Anyway, thanks for reading to this point. Welcome to my life. Let's go on an adventure!
